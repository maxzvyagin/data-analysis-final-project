      "  (born December 28, 1954) is an  American   serial killer . Officially convicted of two murders, one of which occurred while he was still underage, Ables was later connected via  DNA  evidence to two other murders in 2006: of 84-year-old retiree Adeline McLaughlin in 1983, and his 31-year-old girlfriend Deborah Kisor in 1987. Because of their romantic involvement, Ables will not be charged with Kisor's killing, and is yet to be tried to McLaughlin's. [1]  He is currently serving a  life  sentence for killing another girlfriend, 48-year-old Marlene Burns, in 1990. [2] \n",
      "         edit Ables' first murder occurred at age 16 in 1970, when he killed a man during a robbery in  St. Petersburg . He was quickly arrested for that murder, and in March 1971 plead guilty to first-degree murder, receiving a life sentence. In 1983, after serving 12 years at a state prison, he was released on parole and got a job as a construction worker.\n",
      " Five months after his release, on June 25th, he broke into the apartment of 83-year-old Adeline McLaughlin, a retired widow from  Worcester, Massachusetts , by breaking through her window. [3]  He suffocated McLaughlin with a pillow and then proceeded to burglarize her apartment. [4]  The killing shocked the neighboring tenants, who knew the Adeline as a mysterious, yet friendly old lady. [3] \n",
      " On  Valentine's Day , 1987, Ables sexually assaulted and murdered his 31-year-old girlfriend at the time, Deborah Kisor, of  Monterey, California . [5]  She was last seen the previous day making a phone call from a payphone in front of an apartment building. Her body, dressed in only a blause and a jacket, was found by a passer-by walking along a path near  Roser Park  bridge. She had bruises on her legs, with a blue pair of jeans laying beside the body. Despite being romantically involved with Kisor, Ables wasn't arrested as a suspect in her murder at the time. [6] \n",
      " On June 4, 1990, after getting into a drunken argument with his new girlfriend and roommate, 48-year-old Marlene Burns, Ables pushed her down the stairs, beating and kicking her to death afterwards. [7]  As he was leaving the apartment and wiping the blood off his hands, he was seen by witnesses, who had already called the authorities to report a domestic dispute. [8]  When police arrived, they arrested Tony on the spot and soon charged him with first-degree murder, holding him without bail at the  Pinellas County  jail. [7] \n",
      " edit In early June, Tony Ables was convicted of killing Burns and sentenced to die in the  electric chair , but two years later, his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment by Justice Bob Barker. The reason for this was that Ables suffered from mental health issues, a claim that was corroborated by his brother Anthony, who said that their rocky childhood, in which their father abused their mother to the extent that she left the family, was a definite contributing factor. [2] \n",
      " The McLaughlin and Kisor murders remained unsolved until 2006, when homicide detectives submitted Ables' DNA to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which matched with evidence found on both women's bodies. Ables wasn't charged with killing Kisor, as they were romantically involved, but officials consider the case closed. As for the McLaughlin murder, he was officially booked for it, but has yet to be charged. [1]  According to Police Major Michael Puetz, there's a strong possibility that Ables could be responsible for other crimes, for which he has yet to be connected with. [9] \n",

      " Tony Alvin Ables  (born December 28, 1954) is an  American   serial killer . Officially convicted of two murders, one of which occurred while he was still underage, Ables was later connected via  DNA  evidence to two other murders in 2006: of 84-year-old retiree Adeline McLaughlin in 1983, and his 31-year-old girlfriend Deborah Kisor in 1987. Because of their romantic involvement, Ables will not be charged with Kisor's killing, and is yet to be tried to McLaughlin's. [1]  He is currently serving a  life  sentence for killing another girlfriend, 48-year-old Marlene Burns, in 1990. [2] \n",

      " Murders [ edit ] \n",
      " Ables' first murder occurred at age 16 in 1970, when he killed a man during a robbery in  St. Petersburg . He was quickly arrested for that murder, and in March 1971 plead guilty to first-degree murder, receiving a life sentence. In 1983, after serving 12 years at a state prison, he was released on parole and got a job as a construction worker.\n",
      " Five months after his release, on June 25th, he broke into the apartment of 83-year-old Adeline McLaughlin, a retired widow from  Worcester, Massachusetts , by breaking through her window. [3]  He suffocated McLaughlin with a pillow and then proceeded to burglarize her apartment. [4]  The killing shocked the neighboring tenants, who knew the Adeline as a mysterious, yet friendly old lady. [3] \n",
      " On  Valentine's Day , 1987, Ables sexually assaulted and murdered his 31-year-old girlfriend at the time, Deborah Kisor, of  Monterey, California . [5]  She was last seen the previous day making a phone call from a payphone in front of an apartment building. Her body, dressed in only a blause and a jacket, was found by a passer-by walking along a path near  Roser Park  bridge. She had bruises on her legs, with a blue pair of jeans laying beside the body. Despite being romantically involved with Kisor, Ables wasn't arrested as a suspect in her murder at the time. [6] \n",
      " On June 4, 1990, after getting into a drunken argument with his new girlfriend and roommate, 48-year-old Marlene Burns, Ables pushed her down the stairs, beating and kicking her to death afterwards. [7]  As he was leaving the apartment and wiping the blood off his hands, he was seen by witnesses, who had already called the authorities to report a domestic dispute. [8]  When police arrived, they arrested Tony on the spot and soon charged him with first-degree murder, holding him without bail at the  Pinellas County  jail. [7] \n",
      " \n",
      " Trial and imprisonment [ edit ] \n",
      " In early June, Tony Ables was convicted of killing Burns and sentenced to die in the  electric chair , but two years later, his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment by Justice Bob Barker. The reason for this was that Ables suffered from mental health issues, a claim that was corroborated by his brother Anthony, who said that their rocky childhood, in which their father abused their mother to the extent that she left the family, was a definite contributing factor. [2] \n",
      " The McLaughlin and Kisor murders remained unsolved until 2006, when homicide detectives submitted Ables' DNA to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which matched with evidence found on both women's bodies. Ables wasn't charged with killing Kisor, as they were romantically involved, but officials consider the case closed. As for the McLaughlin murder, he was officially booked for it, but has yet to be charged. [1]  According to Police Major Michael Puetz, there's a strong possibility that Ables could be responsible for other crimes, for which he has yet to be connected with. [9] \n",
